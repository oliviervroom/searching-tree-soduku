#### Sudoku picking

Testing the application can be done by running the main.py scirpt. In the main.py script you are able to edit the sudoku that has to be solved. On line 12 until 20 you have three options for testing a sudoku.
* Test a string sudoku. This must be a string with integers, how must be seperated by a space.
* Test a list-style sudoku. This must be a list of 9 lists of 9 entries. This can be understood as 9 rows of entries from left to right.
* Test an assignment sudoku. You have the choice between 5 sudoku's. Therefore you can use index `0` until `4`.


#### Presentation

To present the result of the solved sudoku, you can choose between:
* window presentation (`print_style=PrintStyle.WINDOW`)
* console presentation (`print_style=PrintStyle.CONSOLE`)


#### Verbose

For analysing the algoritm we used a live monitoring of the process. You can use it aswell by setting the `verbose` variable to `True`.
